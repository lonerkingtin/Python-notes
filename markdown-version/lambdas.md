# Lambdas Functions in Python
Lambdas are one line functions. They are also known as anonymous functions in some other languages. You might want to use lambdas when you donâ€™t want to use a function twice in a program. They are just like normal functions and even behave like them.

```python3
def square(x):
    return x * x
# But Lamdas are totally different

square = lambda x:x*x
print(square(2))
# You can also store lamda inside of a variable
# In this case we are passing x as an parameter. Basically they are short and # anonymous functions
# Lambdas don't have a name'
```

#### Map() function in Lambdas
* It's a standard function that accepts at least two arguements a function and an iterable
* Iterable can be lists tuples or dictionary
* Runs lambda for each value and then returns
```python3
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
x = map(lambda x:x*x,nums)
print(list(x))
# This shows how map() function works. We are passing lamda function that will square each number in the list nums
```

#### filter() Function
* It takes a list/tuple and filters based on the given condition
* The lambda function needs to be a boolean it can be either true or false
```python3
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
names = ['alex','john','aneesa','aidan','amina','jill','jackson']
data = [
  {'username' : 'alex_1'},
  {'username' : 'axis_07'},
  {'username' : 'aaa'},
  {'username' : 'asthetic'},
  {'username' : 'bob'},
  {'username' : 'jason_07'},
  {'username' : 'razer_07'},
  {'username' : 'pythonista'}
]
# A function that will print the usernames with more than 4 characters
usernames = list(filter(lambda u:len(u['username']) > 4 , data))
for name in usernames:
  print(name['username'])

# A new list with the multiples of two and less than 10
print('\n')
new_list = list(map(lambda num: num*2, filter(lambda num: num < 6   ,x)))
print(new_list)
print('\n')
for nums in new_list:
  print(nums)

# filter names starting with J and adding them to group 1 and names starting with a goes to group_2

group_1 = filter(lambda n:n[0]=='j',names)
print(list(group_1))

group_2 = filter(lambda n:n[0]=='a',names)
print(list(group_2))

# We can also use the list comprehension but it's better to understand how the map() and filter() works
```
